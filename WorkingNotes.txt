Ali to resolve: Template for what needs to go in "yaml pod configs" / what we need from terraform team (e.g. etcd  )

Malcolm to resolve: restrictions on using etcd for storage layer:
  - Use Etcd API V3, not 2 as v2 has issues over HA
  - No reported gotcha's (yet!) on either performance, availability/HA, scalability over using Consul
  - Consul is noted for being a massive resource og, and Etcd is reported as being much better in that respect
  - It is easy (though not the best security-wise) for Terraform to utilise Etcd as a "dumb" Secrets store.
  - We need Terraform/OCP4 installer to also configure Etcd as service, and be HA-capable
  - We need from Terraform team following info for Etcd service to configure Vault:
    - Service Name, Port, HA-Enabled. Ideally Etcd to be advertised via SRV DNS records.
    - Path in Etcd for Vault to store its secrets in
    - Authentication creds: Username+password+TLS Cert file + TLS Private Key file

(From Malcolm) Task@3pts: Configure Vault to utilise Etcd Storage Backend:
  - We need from Terraform team following info for Etcd service to configure Vault:
    - Service Name, Port, HA-Enabled. Ideally Etcd to be advertised via SRV DNS records.
    - Path in Etcd for Vault to store its secrets in
    - Authentication creds: Username+password+TLS Cert file + TLS Private Key file

(From Malcolm) Task@3pts: Configure HA-Capable Etcd Service within OPC4 and/or Terraform LZ build
  - Use Etcd API V3, not 2 as v2 has issues over HA
  - Needs to be HA-capable, even if only one node stood up
  - Needs to feed info to "Task to COnfigure Vault to utilise Etcd Storage Backkend:
    - Service Name, Port, HA-Enabled. Ideally Etcd to be advertised via SRV DNS records.
    - Path in Etcd for Vault to store its secrets in
    - Authentication creds: Username+password+TLS Cert file + TLS Private Key file
